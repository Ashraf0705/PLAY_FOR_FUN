# PlayForFun - Match Winner Prediction Website üèè‚ú®

Welcome to PlayForFun! This is a private IPL (Indian Premier League) prediction game designed for families and small groups to engage in friendly competition throughout the cricket season.

## About The Project

PlayForFun allows a designated "Space Admin" to create a private prediction league (a "Space"). The admin can then invite members (family, friends) using a unique Join Code. Within their space, users can predict the winners of upcoming IPL matches before a set deadline. After matches conclude, the admin enters the official results, and the system automatically calculates points for all participants based on their predictions.

The goal is to provide a simple, fun, and engaging platform focused on the joy of the game and friendly rivalry, without the complexities of typical betting applications.

**Co-created with passion by Shaik Mohammed Ashraf & his AI Friend.**
